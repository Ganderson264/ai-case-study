Amazon is funded through 4 investors mainly large Banks such as DBS BAnk and Mizuho Bank. Amazon has recived 21.5 Billion in funding.
## Business Activities
Amazon was originally made to help recieve books faster and to compete with Barnes and Noble, now Amazon is used to simply deliver whatevr it is you need to your door step in a fast and timely manner.
Amazons inteded customer is anyone who need anything off of thier website. What makes Amazon so great is that their makrket size is the world.
The solution that Amazon has that other competetors do not have is simply being able to buy things from your fingertips and being able to get that product without leaving your home on the same day or the next.
Amazon is using robots in their facility to run all day and all night and not only have they implemented AI in their warehousing but we also have Alexa. I personally use Alexa when i need to buy something. I tell her "Hey Alexa order me a new PS5 Controller" and it will be ordered and charged to my card same day.
##Landscape
Amazon is in the field of e-commerce,Clood Computing,Streaming, and AI.
Amazon has gotten into Digital Streaming as well as Bluetooth speakers with Alexa built in i also know now theyre getting into building Alexa into your actual home.
The other Major companies that are competing against Amazon are Wal-Mart,Target,Hulu and Other foreign websites like it.
## Results

Some of the biggest metrics that Amazon uses to measure their success is, Order Defect Rate,Cancellation rate,Late Shipment Rate,Product ranking,Conversion rate,and ROAS. Amazon grows abput 9% every year.
Amazon is doing 8% better than its top competitor.
## Recomendations
My adive to Amazon to personally make their company better for me would be to sell Guns and Ammo and if not directly get some licensing from other comapanies.
It would beneift their company tremendously becasue USA takes pride in their guns and im sure they would get a lot of sales if we could get guns delivered to our doorstep.
It would utilize AI for vetting and help regulate guns at awider scale in the USA.
Theyre aprropriate because it help regulate guns a lot more at a wider scale.
